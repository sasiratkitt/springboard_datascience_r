##Repeated Buyers Prediction

###Problem Definition
**Context** Merchants sometimes run big promotions (e.g., discounts or cash coupons) on particular dates (e.g., Boxing-day Sales, "Black Friday" or "Double 11" (Nov 11th), in order to attract a large number of new buyers. Unfortunately, many of the attracted buyers are one-time deal hunters, and these promotions may have little long lasting impact on sales. To alleviate this problem, it is important for merchants to identify who can be converted into repeated buyers. By targeting on these potential loyal customers, merchants can greatly reduce the promotion cost and enhance the return on investment (ROI). It is well known that in the field of online advertising, customer targeting is extremely challenging, especially for fresh buyers. However, with the long-term user behavior log accumulated by Tmall.com, we may be able to solve this problem.

**Why do we care?** We provide a set of merchants and their corresponding new buyers acquired during the promotion on the "Double 11" day. Your task is to predict which new buyers for given merchants will become loyal customers in the future. In other words, you need to predict the probability that these new buyers would purchase items from the same merchants again within 6 months.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
