# Repeated Buyers Prediction

Merchants sometimes run big promotions (e.g., discounts or cash coupons) on particular dates (e.g., Boxing-day Sales, "Black Friday" or "Double 11" (Nov 11th), in order to attract a large number of new buyers. Unfortunately, many of the attracted buyers are one-time deal hunters, and these promotions may have little long lasting impact on sales. To alleviate this problem, it is important for merchants to identify who can be converted into repeated buyers. By targeting on these potential loyal customers, merchants can greatly reduce the promotion cost and enhance the return on investment (ROI). Thus the task is to predict the probability that these new buyers would purchase items from the same merchants again within 6 months.

Datasets are obtained from Tianchi website (Alibaba Cloud) [link](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/introduction.htm?raceId=231576), which is running the Repeated Buyers Prediction Challenge. The data sets contain anonymized users' shopping logs in the past 6 months before and on the "Double 11" day, and the label information indicating whether they are repeated buyers of the given merchants. Activity logs include click, add-to-cart, purchase and add-to-favorite for items under different product categories and brands.
